# RoleFerry Fast FAQ for Agencies

## Top 12 Questions Agencies Ask

### Q1: What does RoleFerry do vs. doesn't do today?
**A:** RoleFerry turns job descriptions into personalized outreach that gets responses. We don't do CRM/ATS deep integrations, advanced analytics dashboards, or multi-language support yet - those are roadmap items.

### Q2: What's the difference between job seeker vs. recruiter modes?
**A:** Same core technology, different interface. Job seekers see "Job Preferences" and "Candidate Profile" tabs. Recruiters see "Ideal Client Profile" and "Resume Database" tabs. Both get the same 5-step workflow.

### Q3: Why limit to 3 contacts per company by default?
**A:** Prevents spam, maintains deliverability, and looks professional. You can contact multiple people at the same company, but not too many to avoid looking unprofessional.

### Q4: How is the fit score calculated?
**A:** AI analyzes your skills against job requirements, matches pain points to your solutions, and gives a percentage score with plain-English rationale explaining why you match (or don't).

### Q5: What are pre-flight checks and what does "green" mean?
**A:** Built-in deliverability checks ensure your emails reach the inbox. Green ticks mean your email will likely be delivered successfully. Red means there are issues to fix before sending.

### Q6: How does RoleFerry handle data and privacy?
**A:** We use mock data in demos, no PII in examples. Real users' data is encrypted, GDPR compliant, and never shared. We're SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certified.

### Q7: What's the difference between the tracker vs. CSV export?
**A:** The in-app tracker shows your application pipeline with stages and outcomes. CSV export lets you download data for external analysis or reporting.

### Q8: What's on the roadmap for CRM/ATS integrations?
**A:** Deep integrations with Bullhorn, CEIPAL, and other major platforms are planned for Q2 2024. We'll start with API connections and build from there.

### Q9: How does the AI actually work?
**A:** We use GPT-4 to extract pain points from job descriptions, match them to your skills, and generate personalized outreach. It's like having a personal recruiter for every application.

### Q10: What makes RoleFerry different from other job platforms?
**A:** We're the only platform that turns job descriptions into personalized outreach. Others just match keywords - we match pain points to solutions and craft targeted messages.

### Q11: How much does it cost?
**A:** Pricing starts at [BRACKETS - to be filled] for job seekers and [BRACKETS - to be filled] for recruiters. Enterprise pricing available for teams and agencies.

### Q12: What's the onboarding process like?
**A:** Simple 5-step setup: paste a job description, we extract the details, you confirm the match, select contacts, and launch. Most users are sending their first campaign within 15 minutes.
