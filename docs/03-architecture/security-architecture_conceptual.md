# Security Architecture: Conceptual Level
## RoleFerry Platform

**RM-ODP Viewpoint**: Enterprise (Conceptual)  
**Audience**: Executive Leadership, Board, Compliance Officers  
**Purpose**: Business understanding of security posture and risk management

---

## 1. Security Vision & Principles

### 1.1 Security Mission Statement
**"Protect user data, maintain trust, and ensure platform integrity through defense-in-depth, compliance-first design, and proactive threat management."**

### 1.2 Core Security Principles

#### Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security controls ensure no single point of failure.
- **Perimeter**: WAF, DDoS protection
- **Network**: VPC isolation, private subnets
- **Application**: Input validation, authentication, authorization
- **Data**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection

#### Principle of Least Privilege
Users and systems granted minimum necessary access.
- Job seekers see only their data
- Recruiters access only their workspace
- API services have scoped IAM roles
- Database users have role-based permissions

#### Privacy by Design
Data protection built into every feature, not bolted on.
- PII encrypted by default
- 90-day contact data retention (GDPR minimization)
- Opt-out honored within 1 hour
- User can delete account (right to be forgotten)

#### Zero Trust Model
Never trust, always verify—even internal traffic.
- All API calls require authentication
- Service-to-service communication secured (mTLS)
- No implicit trust based on network location

## 2. Threat Model

### 2.1 Asset Inventory

| Asset | Classification | Impact if Compromised |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|
| **User credentials** | Critical | Account takeover, identity theft |
| **PII (resumes, emails)** | Critical | Privacy breach, GDPR fines |
| **Contact data** | High | Spam, reputation damage |
| **API keys (Apollo, SendGrid)** | High | Service abuse, cost overruns |
| **Database** | Critical | Total data loss, business shutdown |
| **Sending domains** | High | Blacklisting, deliverability failure |
| **Source code** | Medium | IP theft, vulnerability exposure |

### 2.2 Threat Actors

#### External Attackers
- **Motivation**: Financial gain, data theft
- **Methods**: SQL injection, credential stuffing, phishing
- **Targets**: User accounts, database, API endpoints
- **Likelihood**: High (SaaS platforms are common targets)

#### Malicious Users (Spammers)
- **Motivation**: Abuse platform for spam campaigns
- **Methods**: Bulk signups, fake profiles, script automation
- **Targets**: Email sending infrastructure
- **Likelihood**: Medium (rate limiting, content moderation reduce risk)

#### Insider Threats
- **Motivation**: Negligence or malicious intent
- **Methods**: Data exfiltration, credential sharing
- **Targets**: Production database, user data
- **Likelihood**: Low (small team, background checks, least privilege)

#### Nation-State Actors
- **Motivation**: Espionage, disruption
- **Methods**: Advanced persistent threats (APT), zero-days
- **Targets**: Infrastructure, supply chain
- **Likelihood**: Very Low (not a high-value target)

### 2.3 Attack Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Credential Stuffing Attack
**What**: Attacker uses leaked credentials from other breaches to try logging into RoleFerry.

**Impact**: Account takeovers, unauthorized access to user data.

**Mitigations**:
- Rate limiting (5 failed logins → CAPTCHA, 10 → temporary block)
- Password strength requirements (8 chars, uppercase, number, symbol)
- Optional 2FA (Phase 2)
- Monitor for abnormal login patterns (Datadog alerts)

---

#### Scenario 2: SQL Injection
**What**: Attacker injects malicious SQL via API inputs to access/modify database.

**Impact**: Data breach, data manipulation, database takeover.

**Mitigations**:
- Parameterized queries (SQLAlchemy ORM prevents raw SQL)
- Input validation (Pydantic schemas)
- WAF rules (AWS WAF blocks common injection patterns)
- Least privilege DB user (API user can't DROP tables)

---

#### Scenario 3: API Key Exposure
**What**: SendGrid or Apollo API key leaked via GitHub, logs, or misconfiguration.

**Impact**: Service abuse, cost overruns ($10K+ bills), account suspension.

**Mitigations**:
- Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager (not in code)
- GitHub secret scanning (auto-detects leaked keys)
- Rotate keys quarterly
- API usage alerts (Datadog monitors spend)

---

#### Scenario 4: DDoS Attack
**What**: Attacker floods API with requests, making platform unavailable.

**Impact**: Downtime, revenue loss, reputation damage.

**Mitigations**:
- AWS WAF (rate limiting, geo-blocking)
- CloudFront CDN (absorbs traffic, caching)
- Auto-scaling (ECS handles legitimate traffic spikes)
- Incident response plan (DDoS mitigation service on standby)

---

#### Scenario 5: Insider Data Exfiltration
**What**: Employee downloads user database for malicious purposes.

**Impact**: Privacy breach, GDPR fines (up to 4% global revenue), lawsuits.

**Mitigations**:
- Least privilege access (engineers don't need production DB access)
- Audit logs (every query logged in CloudWatch)
- Data masking (PII redacted in staging/dev environments)
- Background checks for all employees

---

## 3. Security Domains

### 3.1 Identity & Access Management (IAM)

**What**: Controls who can access what resources.

**Policies**:
- **User Authentication**: Email/password + OAuth (Google, Microsoft)
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens (15-min expiry), refresh tokens (30-day)
- **Password Policy**: Min 8 chars, complexity rules, bcrypt hashing
- **MFA (Future)**: TOTP-based 2FA for enterprise users

**Business Impact**: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts.

---

### 3.2 Data Protection

**What**: Safeguards sensitive data throughout its lifecycle.

**Policies**:
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 for PII (emails, resumes, passwords)
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all connections
- **Data Retention**: 90-day TTL for contacts, 2 years for audit logs
- **Backups**: Encrypted snapshots (RDS, S3)

**Business Impact**: Compliance with GDPR, CCPA; protects against breaches.

---

### 3.3 Network Security

**What**: Protects infrastructure from network-based attacks.

**Policies**:
- **VPC Isolation**: Public subnets (ALB), private subnets (DB, workers)
- **Security Groups**: Least privilege (DB only accepts traffic from API servers)
- **DDoS Protection**: AWS Shield Standard (free), Shield Advanced (if needed)
- **WAF Rules**: Block common attacks (SQL injection, XSS, bot traffic)

**Business Impact**: Prevents infrastructure compromise, ensures uptime.

---

### 3.4 Application Security

**What**: Secure coding practices and vulnerability management.

**Policies**:
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic schemas (backend), Zod (frontend)
- **Output Encoding**: Prevent XSS (sanitize user-generated content)
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based (FastAPI middleware)
- **Dependency Scanning**: Snyk (detects vulnerable packages)
- **Code Review**: All PRs reviewed before merge

**Business Impact**: Reduces attack surface, prevents exploitation.

---

### 3.5 Email Security (Deliverability)

**What**: Protects sending infrastructure from abuse.

**Policies**:
- **SPF, DKIM, DMARC**: Configured on all sending domains
- **Rate Limiting**: 50 emails/day per mailbox
- **Content Moderation**: AI flags profanity, threats, spam patterns
- **Opt-Out Enforcement**: CAN-SPAM compliance (<1 hour)

**Business Impact**: Maintains deliverability reputation, prevents blacklisting.
