# Product Content Strategy
## RoleFerry Platform

**Version**: 1.0  
**Audience**: UX Writers, Product, Marketing  
**Purpose**: Voice, tone, and microcopy standards

---

## 1. Voice & Tone

### Voice (Consistent Personality)
**RoleFerry sounds**:
- **Helpful**: Your partner, not a pushy vendor
- **Confident**: We know job search automation works
- **Transparent**: Honest about how we work
- **Encouraging**: Celebrate wins, support through struggles

**RoleFerry does NOT sound**:
- Overly formal or corporate
- Gimmicky or salesy
- Condescending or patronizing
- Uncertain or wishy-washy

---

### Tone (Context-Dependent)

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Error message** | Apologetic + Helpful | "Oops, something went wrong. Try refreshing the page." |
| **Success** | Celebratory | "Application created! We're finding contacts now." |
| **Onboarding** | Encouraging | "Great start! Just 3 more steps to see matched jobs." |
| **Empty state** | Motivating | "No applications yet. Apply to your first job to get started!" |
| **Upsell** | Value-focused | "Upgrade to Pro for unlimited applications" (not "You're missing out!") |

---

- ‚úÖ "Not Now" (respectful)
- ‚ùå "Cancel" (negative)
- ‚ùå "No Thanks" (abrupt)

### 2.2 Form Labels

## 5. Accessibility & Inclusivity

- ‚úÖ "Hiring manager" (not "recruiter" for internal folks)

**Avoid**:

- ‚ùå Gendered assumptions (he/she)

---

### 5.2 Plain Language

**Before** (jargon):
```
"Leverage RoleFerry's AI-powered enrichment waterfall to synergize with decision-makers."
```

**After** (plain):
```
"RoleFerry finds hiring managers and sends personalized emails for you."
```

**Principle**: 8th-grade reading level (accessible to all)
