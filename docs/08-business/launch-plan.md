### ProductHunt Post
```
Title: RoleFerry - Turn job applications into conversations with hiring managers

Tagline: Job search automation that finds contacts and sends emails for you

Description:
RoleFerry automates the hardest part of job search: getting in front of decision-makers.

How it works:
1. Click "Apply" on a job
2. We find the hiring manager's email (verified)
3. AI writes a personalized outreach email
4. We send it from our warmed domains (not your Gmail)
5. You get notified when they reply

Why this matters:
- 75% of applications never reach human eyes (ATS black holes)
- 80% of jobs filled through referrals, but most people have no connections
- Email gets 3x better response than LinkedIn InMail

Built for job seekers + recruiters. Free tier available.

First Comment:
Hey ProductHunt! ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Name], founder of RoleFerry.

I built this because I was tired of sending 50+ applications and getting ghosted. Email outreach works, but it's tedious (finding contacts, writing unique emails, tracking replies).

RoleFerry automates all of it. Our beta users are seeing 15%+ reply rates (vs. <5% for blind applications).

AMA! Happy to answer questions about job search automation, deliverability, or AI drafting.
