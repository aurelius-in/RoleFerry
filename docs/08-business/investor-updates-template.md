## Investor Update Best Practices

### Do's
✅ Be transparent (share lowlights, not just wins)  
✅ Show momentum (month-over-month growth)  
✅ Specific asks (not "let me know if you can help")  
✅ Keep it concise (2-3 pages, 5-minute read)  
✅ Celebrate team wins (promotions, hires)

### Don'ts
❌ Fluff (don't bury bad news)  
❌ Excuses (own mistakes, focus on fixes)  
❌ Asking for money (unless actively raising)  
❌ Too frequent (monthly is enough, not weekly)
