# Sales Playbook - Recruiter Segment
## RoleFerry Platform

**Version**: 1.0  
**Audience**: Sales Team, Founders  
**Purpose**: Repeatable process for closing recruiter customers

---

## 1. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### 1.1 Firmographic

| Attribute | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| **Company Size** | 50-500 employees |
| **Industry** | Tech (SaaS, fintech), Professional Services |
| **Hiring Volume** | 10-50 hires/year |
| **Budget** | $5K-$25K/year for recruiting tools |
| **Team Size** | 1-5 recruiters |

**Why**: Large enough to pay, small enough to close quickly (no enterprise bureaucracy)

---

### 1.2 Psychographic (Buyer Persona)

**Name**: Sarah, Head of Talent

**Title**: Head of Talent, VP People, Recruiting Lead

**Pain Points**:
- LinkedIn Recruiter too expensive ($8K/seat/year)
- InMail reply rates <5% (frustrating)
- Need to hire fast (5 open roles, pressure from CEO)
- Manual email outreach (time-consuming, no tracking)

**Goals**:
- Fill roles faster (reduce time-to-hire from 60 → 30 days)
- Cut recruiting costs (LinkedIn → RoleFerry = 80% savings)
- Prove ROI to CEO (show reply rates, pipeline metrics)

---

## 2. Outreach Strategy

### 2.1 Lead Sources

| Source | Volume/Month | Conversion | CAC |
|--------|--------------|------------|-----|
| **LinkedIn outbound** | 100 | 5% → 5 demos | $50 (time) |
| **Inbound (website)** | 20 | 20% → 4 demos | $0 |
| **ATS partnerships** | 10 | 30% → 3 demos | $0 |
| **Referrals** | 5 | 50% → 2-3 demos | $0 |

**Focus**: Inbound + referrals (highest conversion, lowest cost)

---

### 2.2 Cold Outreach Template (LinkedIn)

**Subject**: Quick question about [Company]'s recruiting

```
Hi Sarah,

I noticed [Company] is hiring for [Role 1] and [Role 2] (saw on LinkedIn).

Quick question: How are you reaching passive candidates right now?

We built RoleFerry to help talent teams like yours:
→ Find decision-makers (not just HR)
→ Send personalized emails at scale
→ Track replies & pipeline

Happy to show you (15 min) if you're open to a better way than InMail.

- [Your Name]
Founder, RoleFerry
```

**Why It Works**:
- Personalized (mentions specific roles)
- Asks question (not pushy)
- Clear value prop (better than InMail)
- Low commitment (15 min)

## 3. Discovery Call (15 Minutes)

### 3.1 Objectives

1. **Qualify**: Are they ICP? (hiring volume, budget, pain)
2. **Understand**: What tools do they use now?
3. **Pain**: What's frustrating about current process?
4. **Next Step**: Schedule demo (30 min) or disqualify politely

---

### 3.2 Discovery Questions

**Current State**:
- "Walk me through how you source candidates today."
- "What tools do you use?" (LinkedIn Recruiter? ATS? Spreadsheets?)
- "How many roles are you hiring for right now?"

**Pain**:
- "What's the most frustrating part of sourcing?"
- "How are your InMail reply rates?" (often <5%)
- "How long does it take to fill a typical role?" (60+ days?)

**Decision Process**:
- "Who else is involved in buying decisions?" (CEO? CFO?)
- "What's your budget for recruiting tools?" ($5K-$25K sweet spot)
- "When do you need to make a decision?" (urgency?)

**Closing**:
- "Based on what you've shared, I think RoleFerry could help. Want to see a quick demo?"

---

## 4. Demo Call (30 Minutes)

### 4.1 Demo Flow

**1. Set Context** (2 min):
- "Before we dive in, tell me about one role you're struggling to fill."
- Use their example throughout demo (personalized)

**2. Show Don't Tell** (20 min):
- **Import Leads**: "Here's how you'd import 50 leads from LinkedIn CSV."
- **Enrich**: "We find their work email + verify it (15% reply rate vs. 5% InMail)."
- **Persona Filter**: "Filter for VPs only, 100-500 employee companies."
- **Draft Email**: "AI writes first draft based on your job description."
- **Sequence**: "3-step sequence: intro, follow-up, last try."
- **Track**: "See who opened, clicked, replied—all in one place."

**3. Differentiation** (5 min):
- **vs. LinkedIn**: Email beats InMail (3x reply rate), 90% cheaper
- **vs. Apollo**: Built for recruiting (not sales), managed deliverability
- **vs. Manual**: 10x faster, better tracking

**4. Pricing** (3 min):
- Teams: $149/user/month (5 users = $745/month = $8,940/year)
- vs. LinkedIn: $8,000/user/year × 5 = $40K/year
- **Savings**: $31K/year (78% cheaper)

**5. Close** (2 min):
- "Sound like a fit?"
- "Ready to pilot with one role?"

---

### 4.2 Objection Handling

**"We're happy with LinkedIn Recruiter"**:
- "I hear that. Are you happy with 3-5% InMail reply rates? Our customers see 15-20% with direct email."

**"Too expensive"**:
- "Compared to what? LinkedIn is $8K/seat. We're $1,788/seat. If we help you fill one role faster, we've paid for ourselves." (agency fees: $20K/hire)

**"We need to think about it"**:
- "Totally fair. What specifically do you need to think about? (uncover real objection)
- "How about a pilot? Try RoleFerry for one role, 30 days. If it doesn't work, we'll refund."

**"We don't have budget"**:
- "When does your fiscal year start? Let's stay in touch." (disqualify for now)
