## Slide 3: Solution

**Headline**: "One-click Apply → Intelligent Contact → Personalized Outreach"

**How It Works** (3 Steps):
1. **Click Apply** → RoleFerry finds hiring manager
2. **AI Writes Email** → Personalized draft (references resume)
3. **We Send It** → From our warmed domains (15% reply rate)

## Talking Points (Objection Handling)

**Q**: "Why will users pay $49/month?"  
**A**: "One interview from RoleFerry pays for 6 months. Our beta users see 15% reply rates—3x better than blind applications. They'll pay for results."

**Q**: "How do you compete with free tools (Simplify)?"  
**A**: "Simplify tracks. We act. Users pay for automation + results, not passive spreadsheets. Different value prop."
