- **Channels**: SEO, content, Reddit, partnerships with career coaches
- **Pricing**: Free + Pro ($49/mo)

### Phase 2: Recruiters (Months 7-12)
**Why second**: Requires product maturity (bulk features, integrations).
- **Goal**: 500 recruiter seats, 10 enterprise pilots
- **Channels**: Outbound sales, ATS partnerships, events

## Conclusion

RoleFerry's primary market is **active job seekers** (3-15 YOE, white-collar) seeking efficiency and results in their search. The secondary market—**recruiters**—offers higher ARPU and retention but requires additional product investment. Both segments share the same core pain: **inefficient manual outreach** that could be automated with intelligence + infrastructure.

Our differentiation—**click-to-contact** + **deliverability**—creates a 10x improvement over spreadsheets (job seekers) and basic sales tools (recruiters), justifying a $500M+ TAM capture over 5 years.
