---

### 2.2 Willingness to Pay

**Question**: "How much would you pay for a tool that gets you 3x more interviews?"

| Price Point | % Would Pay | Cumulative |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| $10/month | 68% | 68% |
| $25/month | 48% | 48% |
| **$49/month** | **32%** | **32%** ← Our price |
| $75/month | 18% | 18% |
| $100/month | 8% | 8% |

**Insight**: $49/month captures 32% of market (sweet spot: perceived value > price).

|---------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **Find hiring manager emails** | 85% | 12% | 3% |

## 3. Key Findings - Recruiters

### 3.1 Tool Stack Analysis

**Current Tools** (survey of 100 recruiters):
- 80% use LinkedIn Recruiter ($8K/year)
- 60% use ATS (Greenhouse, Lever, Workable)
- 40% use email tools (Apollo, Instantly, manual Gmail)
- 30% use spreadsheets for tracking

**Pain Points**:
- LinkedIn InMail: 5% reply rate (too low)
- Email finding: Manual, time-consuming (Hunter.io hit-or-miss)

- <$5K: 20% (small teams)
- $5K-$25K: 45% (mid-market) ← Our target
- $25K-$100K: 25% (enterprise)
- >$100K: 10% (large enterprise)

**Insight**: Sweet spot is $5K-$25K budgets. RoleFerry at $1,788/year (Pro) fits easily.

## 4. Competitor User Sentiment

### Simplify (Job Tracker)
**Positive**:

- "Passive tool, I still do all the work"

**Opportunity**: Users want action, not just tracking.

---

### LinkedIn Recruiter
**Positive**:
- "Largest candidate database"
- "Good filters, search"

**Negative**:

---

## 6. Insights for Product

### MVP Priorities
1. **Contact discovery** (85% "must have")
2. **AI drafts** (72% "must have")
3. **Tracker** (68% "must have")
4. **Deliverability** (implicit, users don't know they need it)

### Phase 2 Priorities
5. **Match scoring** (45% "must have", 40% "nice to have")
6. **Copilot** (users love AI, but not blocking)
7. **LivePages** (25% "must have", mostly indifferent)

---

## 7. Pricing Insights

### Job Seekers
- **Free tier**: Must exist (acquisition), but limit (10 apps/mo forces upgrade)
- **$49/mo**: Accepted if results delivered (15%+ reply rate)
- **Annual discount**: 20% drives 30% to annual (better LTV)

### Recruiters
- **$149/mo**: Cheaper than LinkedIn, comparable to sales tools
- **Teams discount**: Volume pricing expected (5+ seats)
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing, SLAs required (50+ seats)

## 8. Competitive Gaps (Opportunities)

| Gap | Competitors Missing This | RoleFerry Solution |
|-----|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Contact discovery + outreach** | Simplify, Huntr | Our core value prop |
| **Managed deliverability** | Apollo, Instantly | We own sending domains |

| **Affordable email outreach** | LinkedIn Recruiter | 95% cheaper, email-first |

---

### Value Prop
**"Find hiring managers, send personalized emails, track replies—all in one click"**  
**Why**: Combines top 3 pain points (connections, drafting, tracking)

### Social Proof
