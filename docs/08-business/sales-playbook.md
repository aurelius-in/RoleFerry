## 3. Sales Process

### Stage 1: Prospecting
**Lead Sources**:
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator (search "recruiter," "talent acquisition")
- Funding announcements (Crunchbase, TechCrunch)
- Job postings (companies hiring = need recruiters)
- ATS integrations (Greenhouse, Lever user lists)

**Outreach Sequence**:
```
Day 1: LinkedIn connection request (mention trigger event)
Day 3: Email (if email found): "LinkedIn Recruiter alternative"
Day 7: LinkedIn message: "Quick question about your recruiting stack"
Day 14: Breakup email: "Not the right time?"
```

---

### Stage 2: Discovery Call (30 min)
**Agenda**:
1. **Intro** (2 min): Your role, RoleFerry overview
2. **Current State** (10 min): Questions
   - How many open reqs do you have?
   - What tools are you using? (LinkedIn, ATS, email?)
   - What's your InMail reply rate?
   - How much time spent sourcing vs. interviewing?
3. **Pain Points** (5 min): Identify top 3 frustrations
4. **Demo** (10 min): Show Apply → Enrich → Sequence flow
5. **Next Steps** (3 min): Trial sign-up, follow-up call

**Discovery Questions**:
- "Walk me through your typical sourcing workflow."
- "What's your biggest recruiting bottleneck right now?"
- "How do you decide when to use LinkedIn vs. email?"
- "What would 10x your output look like?"

---

### Stage 3: Demo (15 min)
**Flow**:
1. **Import leads** (CSV upload, 10 LinkedIn profiles)
2. **Enrichment** (show 8/10 emails found, verified)
3. **Sequence** (create 3-step template, launch)
4. **Track** (show CRM view, reply detection)
5. **Analytics** (reply rate, pipeline conversion)

**Objection Handling**:
- **"We use LinkedIn Recruiter"** → "Great! RoleFerry complements it. Use LinkedIn for DB access, RoleFerry for email outreach."
- **"Email feels spammy"** → "That's why deliverability matters. We manage sending domains so your company email stays clean."
- **"Too expensive"** → "We're 95% cheaper than LinkedIn Recruiter. Break-even on 1 incremental hire."

---

### Stage 4: Trial (14 days)
**Onboarding**:
- Day 1: Welcome email + setup call (import first leads)
- Day 3: Check-in (enrichment working?)
- Day 7: Analyze replies (review metrics together)
- Day 14: Upgrade call (convert to paid)

**Success Criteria**:
- 25+ leads imported
- 10%+ reply rate achieved
- 1+ candidate moved to interview stage

---

### Stage 5: Close
**Pricing Presentation**:
- **Pro**: $149/user/month (solo recruiter)
- **Teams**: $99/user/month (5+ seats, $495/month minimum)
- **Enterprise**: Custom (50+ seats, SSO, SLAs)

**ROI Calculation**:
```
LinkedIn Recruiter: $8,000/year
RoleFerry Teams: $1,188/year (1 seat)

Savings: $6,812/year

OR

Agency fee: 20% of $120K salary = $24,000
RoleFerry: $1,188/year
ROI: 20x (if tool helps close 1 hire)
```

**Ask**: "Based on what you've seen, does it make sense to move forward with Pro or Teams?"

## 4. Objection Handling

|-----------|----------|
| "We already have an ATS" | "RoleFerry complements your ATS. We do *outbound* sourcing; ATS handles *inbound* pipeline. We actually integrate with Greenhouse/Lever." |
| "Email deliverability worries me" | "That's our differentiator. We manage 100+ warmed domains. You send from our infra, not your company email." |
| "LinkedIn has better data" | "True. Use LinkedIn for research, RoleFerry for outreach. Email gets 3x better response than InMail." |
| "Too much change for team" | "Setup takes 1 hour. Import your existing leads, launch a sequence. We have onboarding support." |
| "Budget frozen" | "We're $6K/year cheaper than LinkedIn. This is a cost *savings*, not new spend." |
