## 1. Risk Management Framework

### 1.1 Risk Scoring
**Likelihood** × **Impact** = **Risk Score**

| Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score | Priority |
|------------|--------|------------|----------|
| High × Critical | 9 | P0 (Immediate action) |
| High × High | 6 | P1 (Address in 30 days) |
| Medium × High | 4 | P2 (Monitor, plan mitigation) |
| Low × Any | 1-3 | P3 (Accept risk) |

## 2. Technology Risks

### RISK-TECH-001: Deliverability Infrastructure Failure
**Category**: Technical / Operational  
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: Critical (core value prop fails)  
**Risk Score**: 6 (P1)

**Description**: RoleFerry sending domains get blacklisted due to spam complaints, high bounce rates, or ISP policy changes.

**Consequences**:
- Emails land in spam → 0% reply rate
- User churn (product doesn't work)
- Reputation damage (word-of-mouth negative)
- Revenue loss ($50K/month MRR at risk)

**Mitigation**:
1. **Multi-domain pool**: 20+ domains (if one fails, others continue)
2. **Health monitoring**: Real-time bounce/spam tracking, auto-pause at risk
3. **Gradual warmup**: New domains ramped over 30 days
4. **Throttling**: 50 emails/day per mailbox (conservative)
5. **Content moderation**: AI flags spam patterns before sending
6. **Backup plan**: Partner with deliverability services (Instantly, Smartlead) as fallback

**Residual Risk**: Low (after mitigations)

---

### RISK-TECH-002: External API Dependency (Apollo, Clay)
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Risk Score**: 4 (P2)

**Description**: Apollo or Clay discontinues API, changes pricing, or experiences extended outage.

**Consequences**:
- Contact enrichment fails → no emails sent
- User experience degraded (core feature unavailable)

**Mitigation**:
1. **Multi-provider waterfall**: Apollo → Clay → Hunter (3 fallbacks)
2. **Caching**: Company domains cached 30 days, contacts 7 days
3. **Renegotiate contracts**: Annual agreements with SLA guarantees
4. **Build option**: Consider proprietary contact DB (Phase 3)

**Residual Risk**: Low

---

### RISK-TECH-003: Data Breach / Security Incident
**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: Critical  
**Risk Score**: 3 (P2)

**Description**: Hacker gains unauthorized access to database, exposes user PII (resumes, emails).

**Consequences**:
- GDPR fines (up to 4% global revenue)
- User trust destroyed (churn spike)
- Legal liability (class-action lawsuits)
- Regulatory scrutiny (investigations)

**Mitigation**:
1. **Encryption**: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
2. **Access control**: Least privilege, MFA for admin
3. **Penetration testing**: Quarterly external audits
4. **Incident response plan**: 72-hour breach notification (GDPR)
5. **Insurance**: Cyber liability policy ($5M coverage)

**Residual Risk**: Low

---

## 3. Market Risks

### RISK-MKT-001: Competitive Response (Simplify Adds Outreach)
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Risk Score**: 4 (P2)

**Description**: Simplify (500K users) adds contact discovery + email sequences, matching our core features.

**Consequences**:
- Direct competition (share of market)
- Price pressure (race to bottom)
- Differentiation challenged

**Mitigation**:
1. **Speed to market**: Launch 6-12 months ahead (first-mover advantage)
2. **Deliverability moat**: They can't replicate 100+ warmed domains quickly
3. **AI differentiation**: Invest in Copilot, match scoring (hard to copy)
4. **Brand**: Build "deliverability expert" positioning

**Residual Risk**: Medium (even with mitigations, competition is real)

---

### RISK-MKT-002: Market Size Overestimation
**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: High  
**Risk Score**: 2 (P3)

**Description**: Addressable market smaller than projected (TAM $45B too optimistic).

**Consequences**:
- Growth ceiling lower than expected
- Investor returns diminished
- Difficulty raising follow-on rounds

**Mitigation**:
1. **Conservative SAM**: $12B (vs. $45B TAM) already accounts for this
2. **Adjacent markets**: Expand to sales prospecting, partnerships (if recruiting saturates)
3. **International**: UK, Canada, Australia (expand geographic TAM)

**Residual Risk**: Low

---

### RISK-MKT-003: Economic Recession (Hiring Freeze)
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Risk Score**: 4 (P2)

**Description**: Economic downturn → companies freeze hiring → job seekers decrease applications.

**Consequences**:
- Demand drops (fewer active job seekers)
- Recruiter churn (no open reqs)
- Revenue decline

**Mitigation**:
1. **Countercyclical user**: Passive job seekers increase in recession (looking to leave)
2. **Pivot to recruiters**: Agency recruiting grows in downturn (companies outsource)
3. **Adjacent use cases**: Career coaches, outplacement (countercyclical)
4. **Pricing flexibility**: Lower prices to maintain volume

**Residual Risk**: Medium

---

## 4. Regulatory Risks

### RISK-REG-001: CAN-SPAM Enforcement Action
**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: Critical  
**Risk Score**: 3 (P2)

**Description**: FTC investigates RoleFerry for CAN-SPAM violations (spam complaints, no opt-out).

**Consequences**:
- Fines ($46,517 per violation × volume = $millions)
- Injunction (forced shutdown)
- Reputation damage

**Mitigation**:
1. **Compliance by design**: Auto-footer, opt-out within 1 hour
2. **Legal review**: Lawyer-approved email templates
3. **User education**: In-app tips on compliant outreach
4. **Monitoring**: Track spam complaint rate (<0.05% target)
5. **Enforcement**: Ban users who violate policies

**Residual Risk**: Low

---

### RISK-REG-002: GDPR Fine (EU Expansion)
**Likelihood**: Low (Phase 3)  
**Impact**: Critical  
**Risk Score**: 3 (P2, but only if we enter EU)

**Description**: EU Data Protection Authority fines RoleFerry for GDPR violation (data breach, improper consent).

**Consequences**:
- Fines up to 4% global revenue (or €20M, whichever higher)
- Injunction in EU (lose market)

**Mitigation**:
1. **Phase 3 only**: Don't enter EU until GDPR-compliant (data residency, DPO)
2. **Privacy by design**: 90-day contact deletion, self-service data export/delete
3. **Legal counsel**: EU privacy lawyer on retainer
4. **Certification**: Aim for GDPR certification badge

**Residual Risk**: Low (if we execute Phase 3 plan)

---

## 5. Operational Risks

### RISK-OPS-001: Key Personnel Loss (CTO Departure)
**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: High  
**Risk Score**: 2 (P3)

**Description**: CTO (or other critical role) leaves suddenly.

**Consequences**:
- Knowledge loss (architecture, codebase)
- Delayed product roadmap
- Team morale impact

**Mitigation**:
1. **Documentation**: Architecture docs, runbooks (this repo!)
2. **Knowledge sharing**: Code reviews, pair programming
3. **Succession planning**: Identify backup leads
4. **Retention**: Competitive comp, equity, culture

**Residual Risk**: Low

---

### RISK-OPS-002: Scaling Pains (10K → 100K Users)
**Likelihood**: High (if successful)  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Risk Score**: 6 (P1)

**Description**: Rapid growth causes infrastructure, process, or organizational strain.

**Consequences**:
- Performance degradation (slow API, failed jobs)
- Support backlog (can't respond to users)
- Engineering burnout (on-call fatigue)

**Mitigation**:
1. **Infrastructure**: Auto-scaling (ECS, Celery workers)
2. **Monitoring**: Proactive alerts before failures
3. **Hiring**: Scale team ahead of growth (hire at 5K users, not 15K)
4. **Processes**: Formalize on-call, release process, incident response

**Residual Risk**: Medium (scaling is inherently challenging)

---

## 6. Financial Risks

### RISK-FIN-001: API Cost Overruns
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Risk Score**: 4 (P2)

**Description**: Enrichment/LLM costs exceed projections (e.g., spam users, inefficient usage).

**Consequences**:
- Gross margins compressed (target 70%, actual 40%)
- Cash burn accelerates

**Mitigation**:
1. **Usage caps**: Free tier = 30 enrichments/month (prevents abuse)
2. **Monitoring**: Alert if API spend >$10K/month
3. **Optimization**: Cache aggressively, batch API calls
4. **Pass costs**: Usage-based pricing ($0.10/contact) covers overage

**Residual Risk**: Low

---

### RISK-FIN-002: Fundraising Failure (Can't Raise Series A)
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: Critical  
**Risk Score**: 6 (P1)

**Description**: Metrics insufficient for Series A (need $1.5M ARR, 85% retention by Month 18).

**Consequences**:
- Runway exhausted (forced shutdown or acquihire)
- Layoffs (cut team to extend runway)

**Mitigation**:
1. **Capital-efficient growth**: Organic CAC → $0 (vs. paid $50)
2. **Profitability path**: Target break-even by Month 24 (don't require Series A)
3. **Revenue diversity**: Job seekers + recruiters + usage (not single revenue stream)
4. **Raise early**: Initiate Series A at Month 15 (3-month buffer)

**Residual Risk**: Medium (market-dependent)

---

## 7. Reputational Risks

### RISK-REP-001: User Misuse (Platform Abuse for Spam)
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Risk Score**: 4 (P2)

**Description**: Users send spam/harassment via RoleFerry, damaging brand and deliverability.

**Consequences**:
- Sending domains blacklisted
- Bad press ("RoleFerry used for spam campaigns")
- Regulatory scrutiny

**Mitigation**:
1. **Content moderation**: AI flags profanity, threats, spam patterns
2. **Usage caps**: 50/day per mailbox (can't spam at scale)
3. **Three-strikes policy**: Warn → suspend → ban
4. **Monitoring**: Track spam complaint rate per user
5. **Reputation**: Position as "ethical outreach" (vs. cold email spam)

**Residual Risk**: Low
