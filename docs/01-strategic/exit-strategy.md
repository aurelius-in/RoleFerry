# Exit Strategy & Long-Term Vision
## RoleFerry Platform

**Version**: 1.0  
**Audience**: Founders, Board, Investors  
**Purpose**: Define potential exit paths and value creation

---

## 1. Exit Philosophy

**Primary Goal**: Build sustainable, profitable business (not flip)

**Secondary Goal**: Create optionality (M&A or IPO when valuation optimal)

**Timeline**: 7-10 years to exit (patient capital)

---

## 2. Exit Paths

### Path 1: Strategic Acquisition (Most Likely)

**Probability**: 60%  
**Timeline**: Year 5-7  
**Valuation**: $200M-$500M

**Ideal Acquirers**:
1. **LinkedIn** (Microsoft)
   - **Rationale**: Bolt-on to LinkedIn Recruiter, expand email capabilities
   - **Synergies**: 900M users, distribution, brand
   - **Valuation**: 5-8x ARR (at $50M ARR = $250M-$400M)

2. **Indeed** (Recruit Holdings)
   - **Rationale**: Transform from job board to application automation
   - **Synergies**: 300M+ monthly visitors, job data
   - **Valuation**: 4-6x ARR

3. **Workday/ADP** (HCM Suites)
   - **Rationale**: Add recruiting automation to HR suite
   - **Synergies**: Enterprise customer base, payroll/HR integration
   - **Valuation**: 6-10x ARR (enterprise premium)

4. **Apollo/ZoomInfo** (Data Platforms)
   - **Rationale**: Expand from sales to recruiting vertical
   - **Synergies**: Contact data, email infrastructure
   - **Valuation**: 5-7x ARR

---

### Path 2: IPO (Public Markets)

**Probability**: 25%  
**Timeline**: Year 8-10  
**Requirements**: $100M+ ARR, Rule of 40 (growth + profitability >40%)

**Comparables**:
- **ZipRecruiter** (IPO 2021): $418M revenue, $1.2B market cap (2.9x revenue)
- **Upwork** (IPO 2018): $300M revenue, $3B market cap (10x revenue)

**Estimated Valuation** (at $100M ARR):
- **Conservative**: 5x ARR = $500M
- **Aggressive**: 10x ARR = $1B (if high growth, 50%+ YoY)

**Barriers**:
- Public company requirements (SOC 2, audit, board structure)
- Market conditions (IPO window open?)
- Scale (need 100K+ users for liquidity)

---

### Path 3: Recapitalization / Secondary Sale

**Probability**: 10%  
**Use Case**: Founders/early employees take chips off table

**Mechanism**: Private equity buyout OR secondary shares to late-stage VC

**Timeline**: Year 4-5 (after Series B)

**Example**: Sell 20% to PE firm at $100M valuation → $20M liquidity for founders

---

### Path 4: Remain Independent / Bootstrap to Profitability

**Probability**: 5%  
**Rationale**: If we hit profitability ($300K MRR) by Year 2, could self-sustain

**Lifestyle Business**: $5M-$10M ARR, 70% margins, founders take dividends

**Long-term**: Potential to grow to $50M+ ARR independently (no outside capital)

---

## 3. Value Creation Milestones

### Year 1: Product-Market Fit
- **Target**: $300K ARR, 60% retention
- **Valuation**: $3M-$5M (seed stage, 10x ARR)

### Year 2: Scale & Efficiency
- **Target**: $1.5M ARR, 10K users, 85% retention
- **Valuation**: $15M-$30M (Series A, 10-20x ARR)

### Year 3: Multi-Product
- **Target**: $5M ARR, 50K users, recruiter mode at scale
- **Valuation**: $50M-$100M (Series B, 10-20x ARR)

### Year 5: Market Leader
- **Target**: $20M ARR, 200K users, enterprise traction
- **Valuation**: $100M-$300M (Series C or acquisition range)

### Year 7: Exit Window
- **Target**: $50M ARR, 500K users, profitable
- **Valuation**: $200M-$500M (strategic acquisition, 4-10x ARR)

---

### 4.2 Due Diligence Preparation

**Documents Acquirer Will Request**:
- [ ] Financial statements (3 years)
- [ ] Customer contracts (enterprise)
- [ ] IP assignments (employee agreements)
- [ ] Cap table (ownership, options)
- [ ] Litigation history (none expected)
- [ ] Privacy/security audits (SOC 2)
- [ ] Code repository access (GitHub)
- [ ] Customer references (10 enterprise customers)

**Lead Time**: 6 months (assemble clean data room)

---

## 5. Founder Outcomes

### Scenario 1: $250M Acquisition (Year 5)

**Assumptions**:
- $25M ARR at acquisition
- 10x ARR valuation
- Founders own 60% (post-dilution)

**Founder Payout**: $250M × 60% = **$150M**

**Per Founder** (2 co-founders): $75M each

---

### Scenario 2: $500M Acquisition (Year 7)

**Assumptions**:
- $50M ARR
- 10x ARR valuation
- Founders own 40% (post-Series B dilution)

**Founder Payout**: $500M × 40% = **$200M**

**Per Founder**: $100M each

---

### Scenario 3: Bootstrap (No Exit)

**Assumptions**:
- $10M ARR, 70% margin
- $7M profit/year
- Founders own 80% (minimal dilution)

**Annual Distributions**: $7M × 80% = $5.6M/year (perpetuity)

---

## 6. Strategic Decisions Impact on Exit

### Decision 1: Raise Series A vs. Bootstrap

**Raise Series A**:
- ✅ Faster growth (hire more, spend more)
- ✅ Higher valuation (scale to $50M ARR)
- ❌ Dilution (founders 60% → 40%)

**Bootstrap**:
- ✅ Maintain ownership (80%+)
- ✅ Lifestyle business option (dividends)
- ❌ Slower growth ($10M ARR max?)

**Decision Point**: Month 18 (based on profitability trajectory)

---

### Decision 2: Enterprise vs. SMB Focus

**Enterprise**:
- ✅ Higher valuation multiples (10x ARR vs. 5x for SMB)
- ✅ Attractive to strategic acquirers (Workday, ADP)
- ❌ Slower sales cycles, higher CAC

**SMB** (current plan):
- ✅ Faster growth (product-led, low CAC)
- ✅ Easier to scale (self-serve)
- ❌ Lower valuation multiples

**Decision**: Start SMB, add enterprise (Year 2+) for valuation boost.
