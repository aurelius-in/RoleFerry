Oliver:
Dave March and I are having a RoleFerry.com meeting.  The meegin started.  Starting transcription.  going on ChatGPT and putting in things like, hey, I'm trying to email hiring managers at scale to get a job, and it's like, oh, you should talk to David Marsh. Really? Yeah. So GPT has got your back, man. Yeah, I just put the post up on LinkedIn. That's fucking crazy. Like, you probed GPT to be like, I need a career coach to know how to do outbound marketing with emails like Apollo instantly, and like, oh, you should speak to David Marsh. Like, of all the fucking people in the world, while ChatGPTQ responded back with me. And the robot's approved, man. The AI is your friend, I'm telling you. You did something, you did something right in your SEO or something. Good job. Well, search engine optimization doesn't have to cost money if you know what you're doing. Well, shit, something's go ahead happening. I don't know what the fuck is happening. That's good. You know, it's a good thing. I'm just, I'm just, I'm shocked. I don't even know what the fuck. This is crazy to me. Yeah, that's actually, that's pretty neat, man. Like, what can I say? Like, it's fantastic news. So, yeah. But that's why I'm like pushing on you, because we say we're doing something right, and, like, ChatGPT is sending us leads, so we should probably get going on this thing. Yeah. I agree.

Speaker (unclear):
Wireframes, right? So I can click under it. But what I was curious about was the reason why I said that was like, I'm more about protecting the IP, like the intellectual property. You know, like this like workflow that we created is pretty nice, and I was thinking like, maybe they shouldn't have access to the workflow like that, and you should only get it through creating an account. But I don't know what you think. We can fix that if you want. I don't, I'm not, I'm not like Concerned about it. Yeah, I don't, I don't think that's gonna be a problem for us. Okay. But I mean, you know, because it's a team effort here, if you feel like you're concerned, I can, you know, we can put up some guardrails, but yeah, that's totally up to you. And like, I personally worry less about that stuff than some people do, because I haven't had big problems with it, with that specific type of problem, like, you know. Yeah. I mean, I don't know, people get this stuff stolen all the time, I guess for me, I'm, I don't. It's just, it's just a logical workflow. I feel like there's a million apps that have a workflow. Ours isn't even that refined yet. I don't think our intellectual property is that like, I don't know, it's not refined enough to even steal, but you know, we'll get there, but I just think that like right now we're trying to get a working app, and there's like so many other apps that do similar stuff. I don't think there's anything about us that they're gonna be like, oh my God, this is so genius, I have to steal their idea when there's like 20 other apps that do other overlapping things in different ways, but not quite, you know. I don't know, there are a lot of other competitors, so I just don't know why they'd steal our stuff just because we have some like amateur, like half-baked thing that's not even online yet, you know what I mean? Yeah, cool. I'll lock it up if you want, like, it's not a problem. No, no, you don't lock it up. Yeah, it's the wrong idea. I was just thinking at times, but, you know, it's just a thought. It wasn't like something I'm really passionate about. Yeah, no, I give you, I'm totally, like I said, this is a team effort, so if you want me to be more secure about access, then that's not a problem. And a lot of people feel that way, and I'm certainly happy to comply, and we'll, there's all kinds of ways to do that, and I'm happy to do it. Yeah, I mean, maybe when we get to like more of a stronger level.

Speaker (unclear):
It's like job preferences. Let's see, job preferences looks good. This is the first page, but second page, the resume, the bottom doesn't have available variables from this step. It doesn't have that on the bottom. So for the actual app, we want to mirror the, this is for the transcript, by the way. So for the app itself, because I am recording, for the app itself, we want to mirror what the wireframe has on the resume page, which is the available variables. Say that 10 times fast. And then, so we've got upload resume, and yeah, and then it just extracts the bits. So after you, after you put your resume on there, it shows the sections, but it doesn't have the little block underneath that says available variables from this step. And so, we wanna show that because later it's going to be used in the assembly of the email. Okay, so instruction number one for the AI gods, we have the wireframe shows us a section called available variables from this step, which is not on the app itself, so we need to add that so that we can pull those variables to later screens. All right, what else do you got? Yeah, and if you wanna, if you wanna give the AI instructions, also, big picture, this is all gonna be used for the email construction methodology. Gotcha.

Speaker (unclear):
All right. Okay, so the next step, well, also on our current step, so we have just look at the titles, because those titles are mirroring the titles on the UI UX, right? So, like the work experience is one title on the live app. If it's a little math to like experience summary on UI. The second one says key metrics. Key metrics is the other one on there. Business challenge is solved. That's good. Notable accomplishments, we got that. Skills got that. Positions held. Okay, this tenure summary, tenure summary is positions held, but those don't have their own unique variables. So, so that's that. Okay, so now we move on to job descriptions, right? Yeah. All right, I'm doing the same thing too with the side-by-side, so we've got this job descriptions. I'll go back to the dashboard and click it from there. So on there. Yeah, you wanna, yeah, yeah, you wanna have a side-by-side. Yeah. Okay, so now we're on job descriptions. Now, first of all, when I input a URL or I input text, it seems like it's not finding out again the company name. Like, it seems like it just took, like, the first three or the first two lines. Yeah, like the first two lines of the job description I put in was here at Scott Motors, we're carrying forward the heritage of one of our most iconic American vehicles in history. And I don't know what that would have been that's job description. And it didn't come up for, like, Scott Motors as the company name. It just took the whole thing, like, at Scott Motors, Green Power, our talented, inclusive, and entrepreneurial.

Speaker (unclear):
So we need to rewrite that logic so that that company comes up quickly, consistently. It was, does it, is this a consistent problem for you or is this, um, happening just occasionally? Well, um, it happens every time I try to input a, um, job description into the job description field. Okay, and that's when you just do the copy-paste, not when you do the URL? Right, I'm just copying and pasting the text. Um, but what if I wanna do a URL, I'll just go to like Scott's Motors, um, because the thing is that, I think that's the problem would be, as I think about it more, um, as we have some time on this for a while now to think about this, the issue is the links. Um, every link, uh, has it differently, right? Like, if I would send in a link, which shows, for example, Scott's Motors, with YouTube, I mean, with the, with Indeed, versus if I went to the direct site versus if I went to, and on LinkedIn, like, it's gonna, the data is gonna be presented differently. Um, so it might not know where to look on the webpage to pull the company name because the way it's presented on Scottsmotors.com versus LinkedIn.com versus Indeed.com is gonna be different. Sure. Yeah. So I mean it, it, it should be smart enough to figure it out, but yeah, it's gonna have to know sometimes, kind of like with the resumes, I had to feed it like, I don't know, like 30 something resumes to like get it to be more consistent when it extracts from resumes. I'm not even sure it's perfect yet. It's probably occasionally gonna make mistakes on resumes, but same thing with job descriptions. We're gonna have to like give it a lot of different job descriptions and then make it work for all those job descriptions, kind of like we did with the resumes.

Speaker (unclear):
That's the nice thing about our smart computers these days, is they can figure it out if you give them enough coaching. Okay. The other thing I like about, the thing I'd like to change about the job descriptions is, instead of like having like those pages come up, I think it should just be a simple list of job descriptions, a simple list of websites they can use to find the job descriptions. Like, it's just almost like a fucking word document. Nothing fancy at all. Yeah. So it's like fail-safe. That's true. Yeah, just some job boards would be good, like popular job boards. Yeah, just popular job boards, fail-safe. You can't get it wrong. It's the same thing every time. We can update it on our end when we find like a cool new job board, but we're gonna give them the job board links, and they just go on there and they put in their search terms, and they do whatever they wanna do. We're not trying to system in the app at all. We're just trying to give them the links. We could even make it like a scrollable thing, so like, kind of like when you do like a job skill and you type and then it populates, you know, and they could kind of like put in their skills and then it pulls up the job boards that relate to their skills because not all job boards are the same. Unless we're shooting for, if we're trying to hit like software types, then, you know, we might have a consistent job board list, but there's different job boards for different types of people, so. Yeah. I mean, you're the expert on this industry, not me. I'm just saying I know there's different ones, right? So. Yeah. No, there is. There is, but I mean, I don't know, I don't know how complicated you wanna get. Oh, it's not that hard. It's not really a matter of, just know, the hard part isn't how complicated it is. It's knowing how we want the flow to be. So, as long as we understand the flow that we're trying to implement, then I think the complicated nature of it is not really an issue. If we can explain how we want it to work to the AI, it'll actually help us do the hard parts. It's knowing what we want it to do and being clear about that. So just having a clear vision is the challenge. You're not figuring out how to make it work. Yeah, it's gonna. Okay, so the clear vision, I think, should just be a list of websites, maybe a heading that puts in like general, generally good job description data you can get from LinkedIn, you know?

Speaker (unclear):
scientist, you know, solutions engineer, and, you know, those more technical kind of positions. Yeah, they have different job boards. Yeah, you could call that headings, you know, things like that, but. Also, like, Google has their own job board for like Google jobs. It's pretty extensive. And there's like specific companies that have like a huge job board for just that company. So, and they have different types of jobs too. So there'll be like people that are more in your lane and people that are more in mine. They have all kinds of management jobs, all kinds of non-software jobs at Google and Amazon and stuff like that. So there's, there's quite a lot of different job boards. The question is, like, there's general job boards and then there's specialized job boards. And we want to know, like, how do we want those specialized ones to populate? So my question is, when they, do they start typing, like, is it like, originally, like, what we have it now, it may not work perfectly yet, but the idea is that we have the preferences page and then that generates their job boards. Wow. Yeah, I mean, I don't know, I don't know if we could do that. I think that's making it more complicated, honestly. I think that the job purpose is the important because it's just important in the sense of being a human. You know, you know, you wanna, you wanna like, know what you're going for and it's more like, it's more like, when I do coaching, I always use that because it's like a frame of reference to remember their preferences. And it's just, that's that it's like, I guess that's kind of just like human. Speaking of the human part, do we want to do any kind of like personality test? I think I asked you this already. I think you said no. But maybe, like, so like it could be an optional, like there could be like a, just to visualize the preferences page, and then somewhere near the top, but in kind of an unimposing font, it says optional, colon, personality test, or something like that, vaguely like that. And then, and then I know that's part of your initial, like, screening, right? And then, and then I don't know exactly, we could ask AI how we could use something like that in this process, or maybe you know, because you've already used it. And that could help with some of this filtering too. Because remember, we have the gaps analysis, right? And that the personality test might present some gaps, and it also might present some matching opportunities. So we could take a couple of matches and gaps from their personality test. It's like, well, you wanna work with people, but this company, blah, blah, blah. And, you know, I don't know, it's a thought. Again, this isn't like adding so much complexity that it's gonna, like, delay our release date. We could probably, you know, do that. And like right now, right now, when we look at the dashboard, what do we see? What do we see? We have the, ah, sorry, my computer's not behaving. So the, yeah, I'm looking at the dashboard. So the, OK, so I'm looking at the 12 things. The job tracker isn't necessarily one of them. As far as steps go. Um, the personality test might be a step. People are on board with personality tests. I've always thought they were kind of weird, but a lot of people are on board with them. I've had a personality test taken at like six different jobs, so it isn't like a foreign thing to people. Not everybody, most people don't. Personality was my number one thing growing up as a kid. I say that because, like, I was interested in that 12, 13 years ago, um, and I've always loved it, um. Yeah, well, like, it might be, it's more of a step than, like, Job Tracker or even analytics. Those things are more like buttons that should be somewhere else than part of the steps. I just like 12 steps, so I left them in there as steps, so we'd have the 12, but we could replace either analytics or Job Tracker with the personality test, right? And then put those buttons somewhere else on the screen, it's like, other things to look at. Yeah, I mean, you know, I think definitely we could put it in. I mean, that's all for more of, you know, relating to them as a human being, you know? that's, you know, it's not really part of the, like, getting you an interview process as much. It's kind of separated. Yeah. I think it helps with the sales a little bit too. Like a marketing so, I mean, this is not my area of expertise, but I can imagine, like, like, we, you know, kind of like the dating sites, right? They say, we look at 12 points of compatibility. I mean, really, really, you're just swiping left or right on most of these apps, one way or another. But I mean, it's like, you're looking for somebody hot and you're like, you don't give a about the rest of that. Unless they're like, unless they're like overly religious or some, some weird, or or they get some like creepy stuff. But, but like the personality test is kind of, kind of like... Mhm. I love this shit. I think it's really, really cool to know about yourself. And I think the philosophically, as I am, I'm a definitely philosophical person, and that you know that. And philosophically, I love it. And I think that, you know, people should look within and find out who they are and all these good things. But it's like, in the business world, no one gives a fucking shit. They just wanna make some goddamn money. Can you get a job? No one cares. I think we're on the same page. Like, I also think pretty deeply about just about everything. But at the end of the day, there's just like a bottom line and people only have so much time and energy to invest in most things. But I think the personality test gives you an angle to talk about the app. Like, it's just something we do that the other ones don't, for example. It only takes a second. You click a couple boxes. It's optional. Like, you don't have to do the personality test. But it helps, you know, like, it makes you, it raises some questions that are good ones to be raised, right? What are they doing that the other people aren't doing where they can find me a job based on my personality? Like, maybe I don't need a resume or something. You know what I mean? It kind of gives you a little extra hope. It's like, well, my resume sucks, but they looked at my personality pretty closely and maybe there's a job out there for me. I don't know. I'm just saying, it gives you a little hope. Maybe you'll like. We wanna get to know you, Bob. We wanna get to know you very well. We're gonna make you fill out some personality tests and we're gonna find you a job. Especially if you have a lot of really high paid experience and great references. Yeah, especially if I did Microsoft for 14 years and you know fucking Bill Gates and... Hold on, who is that? My uncle Ralph coded blue. Does that mean he can't breathe? It means his heart stopped. Oh my God. OK, my uncle is in the hospital. He's gonna pass away or something. He's coded blue in the hospital, so I gotta go. But send me an email and we'll put some notes together and finish this up. But I already got some great notes. I got the transcript for the meeting so far. Sorry, weird medical emergency. All right, bye.
