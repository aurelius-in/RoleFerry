Oliver,

This email will be for the Product Road Map 

This is not being written by AI or any GPT / LLM

We have to do one thing at a time for this be successful, and the first thing we are going to do is build the tool for job seekers. 

We have to serve the starving market, the job seekers will be good testers... the staffing agencies will be good buyers...

the job seekers are the low laying fruit... after the first thing is completed then we can go to the second thing which is the business development for Staffing agencies

Okay so now that, that is established.

Here is the Road map for the job seekers side, we have to make this simple. 

1. Improve the UI and Front-end Design, bring things back to proper functionality and flow, get all the email variables done -  

 start to categorize and organize the things that will be in the staffing agency / Recruiter side of things and the job seeker side of things - 

2.  Start to work on the backend, connecting the email variables to actual things - Friday to Sunday the 16th 

3. Start to work on the backend connecting the email servers to actually send out emails

4. Working on the backend finding the contacts and putting them in. 

5. Working on the backend putting my email templates into the compose section with the email variables pre-set and press send to at least one person. 

6. Start to get testers on LinkedIn. Plus, they also have to agree to fill out a weekly survey on the bugs and ideas to make it better, ideally be apart of the community on skool.   

These people will be in the beginning of the community. 

Once we have like 10 people go through it, then we level up and we go from private success to public success. 

Likely in January, we will level up the pricing and increase setup fee.
