Also in terms of selling this tool, it would be a great idea for this to be sold to business owners that already have a budget for outreach tools. 

B2B  is better than B2C

Dave,

Totally aligned. Let’s sell RoleFerry to teams that already budget for outreach tools. I’m positioning it as a drop-in that cuts cost per qualified lead without forcing a stack change.

Here is what I’m building in first:

- Workspaces and seats with roles, plus Google/Microsoft SSO

- Clay and Apollo CSV import, plus a Google Sheets connector

- Salesforce and HubSpot sync: push Qualified or Rejected, reason codes, and cost

- Instantly and Lemlist webhooks to tag outcomes back in the sequencer

- Caching and per-workspace budget caps to keep checks under control

- Campaign reporting with total checks, qualified rate, and cost per qualified lead


ROI angle to test: I think, like from wjat I read, many teams pay 16 to 35 cents per lead check; I'm pretty sure our target can be easily under 10 cents with better acceptance rates.

I’ll keep our scheduled call in an hour and try to have a short walk-through ready.
